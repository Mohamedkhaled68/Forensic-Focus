The car was locked from the inside, and there were no signs of robbery or other criminal activities indicating any motive other than premeditated murder.",

Nearby, investigators discovered a torn piece of the ranger’s uniform, a flashlight with blood smudges, and fresh footprints leading into the dense woods.\n\nThe area is known for its wildlife activity and rugged terrain, making it difficult to navigate without expertise. Initial observations suggest that the disappearance could be linked to foul play, though an animal attack has not been ruled out. The site showed signs of a struggle, including broken branches and disturbed ground.",
